            <p class="lots-of-text"><a href="/">headcount.io</a> is a lightweight web application for collecting RSVPs to events. After you create an event, headcount.io gives you a shortlink to send to whoever you want to RSVP. The event organizer can then see who is RSVPing, watch the event fill up, quickly email all event attendees, and other useful features. This application was originally constructed as part of the <a href="http://djangodash.com/archive/2013/">2013 Django Dash competition</a>.</p>
